# This file serves as a placeholder for the web favicon
# In a real project, this would be a 32x32 or 16x16 PNG image for web favicons
# You can replace this with your actual favicon file

# The favicon should be:
# - 32x32 or 16x16 pixels (multiple sizes recommended)
# - PNG format
# - Clear and recognizable at small sizes
# - Consistent with your app's branding
