# This file serves as a placeholder for the Android adaptive icon
# In a real project, this would be a 1024x1024 PNG image for Android adaptive icons
# You can replace this with your actual adaptive icon file

# The adaptive icon should be:
# - 1024x1024 pixels
# - PNG format with transparency
# - Designed to work with Android's adaptive icon system
# - Safe area considerations for different mask shapes
