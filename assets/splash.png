# This file serves as a placeholder for the splash screen
# In a real project, this would be a high-resolution PNG image for the splash screen
# You can replace this with your actual splash screen image

# The splash screen should be:
# - High resolution (typically 2732x2732 for universal)
# - PNG format with transparency support
# - Centered design that works on all screen sizes
# - Matches your app's visual identity
